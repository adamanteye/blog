= What Are Kubernetes Addons

Kubernetes addons are a collection of utilities that make life easier for
cluster operators. They often include networking plugins (CNI), metrics servers,
and other tools to enhance cluster functionality. Most cloud providers ship
clusters with these essentials by default.

For example, EKS provide the followings:
- vpc-cni
- coredns
- metrics-server

And a real production environment usually requires more than the defaults:
components for ingress, observability, storage, and automation are often added
to support day-to-day workloads.

= Core Infrastructure

*Traefik* and *Traefik CRDs* serve as the main ingress controller in the
cluster. Instead of using traditional Ingress objects, I adopt the experimental
#link("https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/")[Kubernetes Gateway API], which
provides a more expressive and extensible model for routing. This setup allows
both L7 HTTP traffic and raw TCP streams to be aggregated under the same
`LoadBalancer` service — a single entry point managed by #link(
  "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html",
)[AWS Load Balancer Controller], which automatically provisions the
corresponding AWS NLB resources.

For observability, I use #link(
  "https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack",
)[kube-prometheus-stack], a comprehensive monitoring suite combining Prometheus,
Alertmanager, and Grafana. It's a straightforward, production-ready solution for
cluster operations, offering metrics, alerting, and dashboards out of the box.

When bootstrapping a new cluster, my FluxCD reconciles prometheus first, before
any workload or operator depending on CRDs such as `ServiceMonitor`. This
ensures that custom monitoring resources are recognized and registered properly
during subsequent deployments.

= Operational Utilities

A common pitfall when starting out is treating the CNCF landscape like a
supermarket: grabbing every shiny graduated project and asking 'do I need this?'

In practice, most of them end up unused. After several iterations, only a few
utilities remain truly valuable in daily operations. One such tool is #link(
  "https://headlamp.dev/",
)[Headlamp] a lightweight Kubernetes dashboard that integrates smoothly with
RBAC.

= GitOps Controller

FluxCD is the backbone of my operational workflow and usually the first
component I deploy after the pod network is up. It continuously reconciles
manifests from the Git repository, ensuring the cluster state always matches the
declared configuration.

Here's an example layout from my repo:

Another advantage of GitOps is that my colleagues won’t fear taking over my
responsibilities once I leave the company.

Everything is declarative and versioned. Anyone with access to the repository
can understand how the cluster is built simply by reading through the git
commits.
